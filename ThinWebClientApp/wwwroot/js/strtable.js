The TrafficServer command is used first on another computer which puts the communication throughput measurement tool server in a listening condition. Then the TrafficClient command is used to connect to that server by specifying its host name or IP address and port number, which makes it possible to measure the communication speed. \nMeasurement of the communication speed is carried out by concurrently establishing multiple TCP connections and calculating the actual number of bits of data that can be transferred within a specified time based on the respective results of transferring the maximum stream data on each connection and then using that to calculate the average value (bps) of communication throughput. Normally when there is one TCP connection, it is common to only be able to achieve communication speeds slower than the actual net throughput because of limitations related to the TCP algorithm. We therefore recommend the establishment of multiple concurrent TCP connections when measuring communication results. Because the throughput that is measured using this measurement method is calculated from the bit length of the data that arrives on the receiver side as a stream by TCP, the packet loss that occurs during transfer and the packets with corrupted data are not included in the packets that actually arrive, which means it is possible to calculate a genuine value that is close to the maximum possible communication bandwidth of the network. \nUsing the measurement results, i.e. the stream size transferred by TCP, the approximate value of data volume that actually passed through the network is calculated and this is divided by time to calculate the bits per sec (bps). The calculation assumes the type of the physical network is Ethernet (IEEE802.3) and the MAC frame payload size is 1,500 bytes (TCP MSS is 1,460 bytes). By specifying the /RAW option, the calculation will not make corrections for the TCP/IP header and MAC header data volume. \n\nNote: This command can be called from the SoftEther VPN Command Line Management Utility.

By using vpncmd, you can connect to a VPN Client, a VPN Server or VPN Bridge that is running on a local or remote computer and manage these services. Moreover, by using VPN Tools mode, you can call the Network Traffic Speed Test Tool and the certificate creation function. These can be used even when not connected to the VPN Server or VPN Client. \nWhen using vpncmd, if the file name is specified by using the /IN and /OUT parameter, the command can be executed in a batch according to a file in which the executable commands are enumerated and the execution results can be written to a file. Normally a command prompt will appear after vpncmd is launched but when an input file is specified by the /IN parameter, the program will automatically terminate after the execution of all lines in the input file is complete. Also, when a command to execute is specified by the /CMD parameter, the program will automatically terminate after the execution of that command is complete.

However you can use this function in general companies. You should read the following cautions.\r\n\r\nNote: This function requires Thin Telework System Server (Private) installed with Government Systems Level Security Mode enabled. The Government Systems Level Security Mode is available on the Beta 5 or later Thin Telework System Server (Private) installers.\r\n\r\nBackground\r\n----------\r\nMost of Japanese government systems are protected by local firewalls. The firewall usually prohibits default communication toward Internet. In this system only specially specified Ip address ranges will be allowed.\r\n\r\nThese specially allowed IP addresses are called \"White list\". You have to send the application to add necessary IP addresses range to your network administrator.\r\n\r\nIn the Normal Mode\r\n------------------\r\nIn the Normal Mode, \"Thin Telework System Server (Private)\" will be load balanced to very large number of relay servers. In this situation IP addresses cannot be predicted. So you cannot define the white list in advance.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the Government Systems Level Security Mode\r\n---------------------------------------------\r\nIn the \"Government Systems Level Security Mode\", the destination IP addresses of the \"Thin Telework System Server (Private)\" when it connects and communicates with the \"Thin Telework System Server (Private)\" are a small number of IP addresses (about 30) that are set up, directly operated and managed in the facilities of the Cyber Technology Research Institute, Industrial Cyber Security Center of the Information-technology Promotion Agency (IPA), Japan. The IP address range is fixed. In principle, communication with outside the range is not required. A list of IP addresses and TCP ports that should be communicated with in this mode (a white list) is available on the following web site.\r\n\r\nhttps://telework.cyber.ipa.go.jp/government_mode_whitelist/\r\n\r\nPlease refer to the above website for the list of IP addresses and port numbers (white list) when you send the order for release to the network administrator.\r\n\r\nNotes on using the \"Government Systems Level Security Mode\".\r\n(1) Although the Thin Telework System (Private) has more than 100 relay gateway IPs in many networks and IP addresses, only about 30 of them will be used when the \"Government Systems Level Security Mode\" is enabled. As a result, there are some disadvantages such as reduced communication performance and availability. We ask for your understanding.\r\n\r\n(2) The range of IP addresses is about 30, but this may increase or change in the future if the number of users of the \"Government Systems Level Security Mode\" increases. In this case, the new range of IP addresses will be announced on the IPA website.\r\n\r\nhttps://telework.cyber.ipa.go.jp/government_mode_whitelist/\r\n","DG_LIMITED_MODE_HELP_TITLE":"About Government Systems Level Security Mode","DG_MAC_SETTINGS_REQUIRED":"Client MAC Address Authentication is enabled, but no MAC address is configured for the client device.\r\n\r\nThe Client device will not be able to connect to this server remotely.\r\n\r\nDo you want to set the MAC address of the client terminal now?\r\n(You will need to find out the MAC address of the Client device at home or elsewhere.)\r\n\r\nAlternatively, you can always start this configuration tool again at a later date.","DG_MENU_HASH_ID":"View &Unique ID...","DG_NO_LOCAL_MAC_ADDRESS_LIST":"The Thin Telework System (Private) Enterprise Policy Enforcement Server currently enforces the Client MAC Address Authentication.

詳しくは\r\nhttps://telework.cyber.ipa.go.jp/government_mode_whitelist/\r\nをお読みください。\r\n\r\n※ 本機能は、インターネットとの通信先 IP アドレスが限定されている行政情報システム等での利用者向けに開発されたものですが、企業等でも利用することは可能です。ただし、注意点 (下部記載) がありますので、ご注意ください。\r\n\r\n※ 本機能を利用する場合は、シン・テレワークシステム サーバー (プライベート版) 側をインストールする際に、予め 「行政情報システム適合モード」 でインストールしておく必要があります。「行政情報システム適合モード」は、Beta 5 以降のインストーラでインストール時に指定できます。\r\n\r\n■ 背景\r\nインターネットとの通信先 IP アドレスが限定されている行政情報システム等には、インターネットとの間の通信はファイアウォール等でデフォルトで遮断されており、事前に申請したクラウドサービス等との間でのみ通信が可能となっているものがあります。\r\n\r\nこの場合、特定通信先として、IP アドレスおよびポート番号のリスト (ホワイトリスト) に対する通信規制の開放を、ネットワーク管理担当者にオーダーする必要があります。\r\n\r\n\r\n■ 「通常モード」の場合\r\n「通常モード」では、シン・テレワークシステム サーバー (プライベート版) は、インターネット上に設置された多数の中継サーバーの IP アドレスのいずれかにロードバランスされて接続されます。この場合、接続先の IP アドレスは可変であり、事前にホワイトリストを作成することができません。\r\n\r\n\r\n■ 「行政情報システム適合モード」の場合\r\n「行政情報システム適合モード」では、シン・テレワークシステム サーバー (プライベート版) が接続・通信を行なう際の通信先 IP アドレスは、独立行政法人 情報処理推進機構 (IPA) 産業サイバーセキュリティセンター サイバー技術研究室の施設に設置し直接運営・管理する、30 個程度の少数の IP アドレス範囲に固定されます。原則としてその範囲外との通信は不要になります。このモードで通信を行なう必要がある IP アドレスおよび TCP ポート番号のリスト (ホワイトリスト) は、以下の Web サイトで公表されます。\r\n\r\nhttps://telework.cyber.ipa.go.jp/government_mode_whitelist/\r\n\r\nネットワーク管理担当者に開放をオーダー送付する際の IP アドレスおよびポート番号のリスト (ホワイトリスト) は、上記 Web サイトの内容をご利用ください。\r\n\r\n\r\n※ 「行政情報システム適合モード」利用時の注意点\r\n(1) シン・テレワークシステム (プライベート版) では、多数のネットワークや IP アドレスで 100 台以上の中継ゲートウェイ IP が設置されていますが、「行政情報システム適合モード」を有効にすると、そのうち約 30 台程度しか利用されなくなります。そのため、通信パフォーマンスが低下したり、可用性が低下したりするデメリットもあります。ご了承ください。\r\n\r\n(2) IP アドレス範囲は 30 個程度ですが、 「行政情報システム適合モード」の利用数が増加した場合は、今後増加・変更になる場合もあります。その場合は、IPA の Web サイトで、新たな IP アドレス範囲を公表します。\r\n\r\nhttps://telework.cyber.ipa.go.jp/government_mode_whitelist/\r\n","DG_LIMITED_MODE_HELP_TITLE":"「行政情報システム適合モード」 について","DG_MAC_SETTINGS_REQUIRED":"「クライアント MAC アドレス認証機能」
